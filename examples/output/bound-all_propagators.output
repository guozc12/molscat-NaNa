  SEGMENT 1 WILL BE PROPAGATED OUTWARDS

  FROM RMIN =      0.50 TO RMATCH =      1.00

  COUPLED EQUATIONS SOLVED BY SYMPLECTIC LOG-DERIVATIVE PROPAGATOR OF MANOLOPOULOS AND GRAY
  USING THE SIX-STEP FIFTH-ORDER METHOD OF MCLACHLAN AND ATELA

  PROPAGATION STEP SIZE DETERMINED USING DR =  1.000E-03
  STEP SIZE CONSTANT THROUGHOUT RANGE
  STEP SIZE MAY BE ADJUSTED SLIGHTLY SO THAT RANGE IS A WHOLE NUMBER OF STEPS

  LOG-DERIVATIVE MATRIX INITIALISED IN THE LOCAL EIGENBASIS AT RMIN IN THE OUTWARD PROPAGATION PART
  LOCALLY CLOSED CHANNELS INITIALISED WITH A WKB BOUNDARY CONDITION

  SEGMENT 2 WILL BE PROPAGATED  INWARDS

  TO RMATCH =      1.00 FROM RMAX =     20.00

  COUPLED EQUATIONS SOLVED BY SYMPLECTIC LOG-DERIVATIVE PROPAGATOR OF MANOLOPOULOS AND GRAY

  PROGRAM WILL ATTEMPT TO CONVERGE ON BOUND STATES AS A FUNCTION OF ENERGY

  FOR EACH LEVEL, THE BISECTION METHOD WILL BE USED UNTIL THE VWDB METHOD OFFERS RELIABLE CONVERGENCE.

  VWDB CONVERGENCE WILL TERMINATE WHEN THE STEP SIZE IS LESS THAN 1.00000E-07 CM-1    

  INPUT ENERGIES IN UNITS OF CM-1 BY DEFAULT.

  PROGRAM WILL SEEK STATES WITH NODE COUNTS FROM    0 TO  99999
